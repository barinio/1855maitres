  cardTitle1: "Good Faith within the framework of the Civil Code of Quebec",
  descriptionCard1:
    "Good faith occupies a central place in Quebec civil law, constituting a fundamental principle which influences and governs the interpretation and application of numerous legal provisions. Concretely, it manifests itself through two main dimensions: as a rule of conduct and as a criterion of interpretation.",
  fullDescription_1_Title1: "Good faith as a rule of conduct",
  fullDescription_1_Text1:
    "In contractual relationships, good faith acts as both a behavioral requirement with respect to the parties during the formation, execution, and resolution of the contract.It requires parties to act with honesty, loyalty and in a manner that does not unduly harm the interests of the other party.This requirement of good faith is reflected in various aspects of the law of obligations, such as contractual negotiation, the exercise of contractual rights and the manner of fulfilling obligations.",
  fullDescription_1_Title2: "Good faith as a criterion of interpretation",
  fullDescription_1_Text2:
    "Beyond its role in the conduct of the parties, good faith also serves as a guiding principle for the interpretation of contracts and legal obligations.It guides courts in investigating the intention of the parties and in the fair application of contractual provisions, ensuring that rights and obligations are exercised in a manner that respects the legitimate expectations of the parties.",
  fullDescription_1_Title3: "The application of good faith in specific situations",
  fullDescription_1_Text3:
    "In consumer contracts: Good faith is of particular importance, with legislators and courts seeking to protect consumers against unfair commercial practices and to ensure fairness in transactions.In matters of civil liability: Good faith influences the assessment of fault and can mitigate or aggravate the liability of the parties depending on their behavior before, during and after the occurrence of the damage.In the exercise of real rights: Good faith plays a role in the possession and acquisition of rights over property, where it can condition the acquisition of ownership or other real rights.",
  fullDescription_1_Title4:
    "Jurisprudence as a vector for the evolution of the notion of good faith",
  fullDescription_1_Text4:
    "Quebec jurisprudence has contributed to the evolution and precision of the notion of good faith, adapting it to the changing circumstances of society and the needs for justice between the parties.Court decisions illustrate the flexibility of good faith and its ability to adapt to a variety of legal situations, thereby reinforcing its status as an underlying principle in Quebec civil law.In conclusion, good faith constitutes a pillar of Quebec civil law, influencing both the conduct of the parties and the interpretation of legal norms.Its scope and application are broad, reflecting the importance of fairness, loyalty and trust in legal relationships.",

  cardTitle2: "Civil Liability: The Essence of Article 1457 of the Civil Code of Quebec",
  descriptionCard2:
    "In the complex fabric of our daily interactions, where every action can have an impact on others, article 1457 of the Civil Code of Quebec presents itself as a beacon of responsibility, illuminating the path towards justice and equity. This article, fundamental in the Quebec legal landscape, establishes a simple but profound principle: if our actions cause harm to someone, we have the obligation to repair the damage resulting from our faults. It is a constant reminder of the importance of our actions and their consequences in society",
  fullDescription_2_Title1: "Fault: First Pillar of Civil Liability",
  fullDescription_2_Text1:
    "The notion of fault is central in the application of article 1457. It encompasses not only malicious intentional actions but also negligence, imprudence, and failures to fulfill our duties. Every time we deviate from the conduct expected of a reasonable person in similar circumstances, we cross the threshold of misconduct. This conceptual flexibility allows the law to adapt to the infinite nuances of real life, providing protection to those affected by the actions of others.",
  fullDescription_2_Title2: "Prejudice: Second Keystone",
  fullDescription_2_Text2:
    "For there to be liability, there must be harm. This harm can be physical, moral, or material. It must be real, direct, and certain. Article 1457 does not simply punish the fault itself; he seeks to remedy the tangible consequences of this fault on the lives of others. It is the recognition that behind every dispute, there are impacted lives, perhaps shattered dreams, and a quest for reparation.",
  fullDescription_2_Title3: "Reparation: Natural Conclusion of Responsibility",
  fullDescription_2_Text3:
    "The obligation to repair is the logical consequence of the fault and the damage. It can take various forms, ranging from financial compensation to restitution, or even reparation in kind. This flexibility allows the solution to be better adapted to the specific problem, seeking not only to compensate but also, wherever possible, to restore the previous state.",
  fullDescription_2_Title4: "Towards a Responsible Future",
  fullDescription_2_Text4:
    "Article 1457, in its wisdom and simplicity, reminds us of the importance of vigilance and prudence in our actions. It embodies the idea that individual freedom finds its limit in respect for the rights of others. As a society, it invites us to pursue an ideal of respectful and responsible coexistence. Every day, as a lawyer, I see the impact this article has on people’s lives. It is not just a legal rule but a principle of life, a guide towards a fairer world. Whether you are the victim of harm or are seeking to understand your obligations, remember that behind legal terms there is a fundamental quest for justice and social harmony. Article 1457 of the Civil Code of Quebec is more than a legal provision; it is a pillar on which the balance of our society rests. By understanding and applying it, we all move forward together towards a future where responsibility and mutual respect are the cornerstones of our coexistence.",

  cardTitle3: "THE PRESCRIPTION",
  descriptionCard3:
    "The limitation period for a personal law action is a complex and essential subject in the legal field, affecting the ability of individuals to take legal action to assert their rights. This article explores the fundamental principles of prescription in personal law, its practical implications, as well as its exceptions and particularities according to Quebec law.",
  fullDescription_3_Title1: "What is Prescription in Personal Law?",
  fullDescription_3_Text1:
    "Prescription in personal law refers to a legal mechanism that limits the time available to bring legal action to claim the performance of an obligation or compensation for damage. The main objective of prescription is to guarantee legal certainty and the stability of social relations by preventing disputes from being reactivated indefinitely.",
  fullDescription_3_Title2: "Limitation Periods",
  fullDescription_3_Text2:
    "In Quebec, the Civil Code of Quebec (CCQ) establishes the general rules of prescription. In principle, article 2925 of the CCQ provides that an action in personal law is prescribed by three years. This time limit means that, in the majority of cases, a creditor has three years from becoming aware of the right of action to initiate legal proceedings against a debtor. It is important to note that “knowledge of the right of action” is not limited to knowledge of the damage or obligation, but also includes knowledge of the person of the debtor. This clarification is intended to avoid situations where a creditor, unaware of the identity of the debtor, would be unfairly deprived of his right of action.",
  fullDescription_3_Title3: "Exceptions and Particularities",
  fullDescription_3_Text3:
    "The CCQ provides for several exceptions to the general three-year deadline. For example, certain obligations arising from the operation of a business, actions for compensation for bodily injury caused by a criminal offense, or even certain claims based on private documents, may be subject to specific limitation periods. In addition, the law provides mechanisms that allow the prescription to be suspended or interrupted. Suspension of the prescription temporarily pauses the countdown of the period, without erasing the time already elapsed, while interrupting the prescription completely resets the countdown of the limitation period.",
  fullDescription_3_Title4: "Conclusion",
  fullDescription_3_Text4:
    "The prescription of an action in personal law is a key concept in civil law, which balances the right of prosecution with the need to ensure a certain social peace. Limitation rules encourage parties to act diligently and resolve their disputes within a reasonable time frame, while providing flexibility through exceptions and suspension or interruption mechanisms. Understanding these rules is essential for anyone wishing to assert their rights in court.",
